# mcskin3d
The super duper 3d skin editing utility!

This project is a fork from [MCSkin3D](https://github.com/Paril/mcskin3d), a program that allows you to draw in 3D and 2D to make Minecraft skins for players and mobs/models alike. 

The project was abandoned since 2016 and hasn't received updates since, it has been replaced by [pmcskin3d](https://www.planetminecraft.com/pmcskin3d/), and is very similar to MCSkin3D but it only runs on the browser.

I created this fork to fix some issues that I encounter when using this program since I use it a lot to edit and create my minecraft skins, and I like it, also to share my fixes with people who still uses MCSkin3D today.

Building this project is kinda weird for now but I will try later to fix some issues to allow building it from source and editing more easy.

Special thanks to [Paril](https://github.com/Paril) and all the [contributors](https://github.com/Paril/mcskin3d/blob/master/bin/thanks.txt) for creating this awesome program!
