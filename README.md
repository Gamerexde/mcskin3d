# mcskin3d
The super duper 3d skin editing utility!

## Introduction

This project is a fork from [MCSkin3D](https://github.com/Paril/mcskin3d), a program that allows you to draw in 3D and 2D to make Minecraft skins for players and mobs/models alike. 

The project was abandoned since 2016 and hasn't received updates since, it has been replaced by [pmcskin3d](https://www.planetminecraft.com/pmcskin3d/), and is very similar to MCSkin3D but it only runs on the browser.

I created this fork to fix some issues that I encounter when using this program since I use it a lot to edit and create my minecraft skins, and I like it, also to share my fixes with people who still uses MCSkin3D today.

## Installation

### Requirements

Before installing you will need Windows 7 or higher and [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/download/details.aspx?id=30653) installed on your system.

#### Windows
To install MCSkin3D you will need to download the [latest release](https://github.com/Gamerexde/mcskin3d/releases) zip, once you downloaded it extract it to a folder and then run the MCSkin3D.exe file to open it.

#### Linux and macOS
MCSkin3D will not work at least natively on Linux or macOS, but you can run it using a windows compatibility layer like [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/), just install [.NET Framework 4.5](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/download/details.aspx?id=30653) with winetricks (wine-mono will not work) and run it with Wine. I have tested it on my laptop running linux and works pretty good.

On macOS running MCSkin3D on Wine will not work if you are on Catalina or higher since Catalina removed all 32 bits libaries from macOS. There are some workarounds to bring back 32 bits on macOS but they are very sketchy and maybe not worth it...

## Compiling

Building this project is kinda weird for now but I will try later to fix some issues to allow building it from source and editing more easy.

## Special Thanks
